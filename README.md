# simple-machine-config-xstate
> A simple dsl (?) to write machine configurations for xstate

> ðŸš§ Still Work in progress ðŸš§ 


According to the  [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) documentation  a  machine config is the same as the state node config with the addition of some properties, a state node:

> ... specifies a state configuration. They are defined on the machine's states property. Likewise, sub-state nodes are hierarchically defined on the states property of a state node.

The idea of this project is to write a simplified version of an xstate machine config.



- Example of xstate machine config:


``` javascript
let trafficlight = {
   initial: "GREEN",
    context: {
       color:"green"},
    states: {
       GREEN: {
	      entry: ['displaycolor'],
	       exit: ['setcoloryellow'],
          on: {
	   time: {
	    target: "YELLOW"
	    }
         }
       },
      YELLOW: {
          entry: ['displaycolor'],
	       exit: ['setcolorred'],
       on: {
        time: {
	  target: "RED"
	    }
        }
      },
      RED: {
          entry: ['displaycolor'],
	       exit: ['setcolorgreen'],
        on: {
	 time: {
	   target: "GREEN"
	 } 
	 }
    }
  }
};
```

### Initial Configuration

 Download an example from the `examples/browser/` folder or just use the scripts:


- xstate.js        ([from the original repo](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) )
- d3.v5.min.js     ([from the original repo](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki))
- dagre-d3.min.js  ([from the original repo](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3/wiki))
- grammarDagreD3.js (from the ./statecharts folder)
- grammarXstate.js  (from the ./statecharts folder)



### Executable statecharts/diagram

  Using [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) and [dagre-d3]( https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3) is possible to create an executable diagram:

> In addition to just using statecharts to model the behaviour in documents separate from the actual running code, itâ€™s possible to use one of various machine formats, both to design the behaviour, and at run-time to actually be the behaviour. The idea is to have a single source of truth that describes the behaviour of a component, and that this single source drives both the actual run-time code, but that it can also be used to generate a precise diagram that visualises the statechart.[[0]](https://statecharts.github.io/)


# State transtion table 

 The description of the state machine/statecharts used in this project follow the idea of a `state transition table` with  this format:
 
``` javascript
  STATE input STATE  <function> 
```

> In automata theory and sequential logic, a state-transition table is a table showing what state (or states in the case of a nondeterministic finite automaton) a finite-state machine will move to, based on the current state and other inputs. It is essentially a truth table in which the inputs include the current state along with other inputs, and the outputs include the next state along with other outputs.
