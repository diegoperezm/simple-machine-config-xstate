** State-transition table

[State-transition table:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-transition_table)

> A state-transition table is a table showing what state ... a finite state machine will move to, based on the current state and other inputs.
 It is essentially a truth table in which the inputs include the current state along with other inputs, and the outputs include the next state along with other outputs.
